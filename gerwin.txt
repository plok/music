!! GIT TEST FROM WINDOWS !!

I just added this line with IDEA. Let's see if we can now commit this new version into the LOCAL Git repository.

Yippie ya yeey!! This just workt, a local commit from IntelliJ!

Now let's try a "commit and push"!! :)

Push did not work it seems :( :(

Ok, a push only did wok fine now! :D

I now had to give my key phrase. Added it to the password repo so I do not need to keep giving it.

 Let's try a "commit - push" again.....

 Ok, commit and push at the same ime does not seem to work. Well, no problem, this is not the way to go with Git anyway.. :)
